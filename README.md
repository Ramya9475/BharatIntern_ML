# HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION USING LINEAR REGRESSION

House price prediction is about using data and machine learning to estimate the value of homes. It involves collecting data, training models, and evaluating their accuracy. The goal is to provide reliable property value estimates for buyers, sellers, and investors in the real estate market.

Mathematical models are used to value homes through linear regression and home values ​​are calculated based on factors such as square footage, number of beds, location, and historical sales data. This simple and explainable approach is often used in real estate, providing valuable insights for buyers, sellers and investors. However, it assumes a continuous relationship between supply and prices, which may not always hold in complex real estate markets.

# Steps involved in this prediction
